We are developing an app named ReHydrate. A simple hydration reminder tool that has multiple ways to remind you to hydrate such as:
-A custom time reminder
-A reminder set in intervals
-And the ability to set how urgent the reminder is

We hope to alleivate the problem that is going on in our society by developing this application. And we think it is going to be of great help to you.
Stay Hydrated!
